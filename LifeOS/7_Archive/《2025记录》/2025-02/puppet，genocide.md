Its great living here in Xinjiang so i can directly debunk these claims now!

I spoke to many Uyghurs over the past few days, a lot didn’t celebrate at all, a couple did a small meal with their family, but surprisingly.. nobody was forced to do ANYTHING! Just asked a local friend about this claim and he laughed, saying many Chinese tourists come here so workers can get paid extra to do this kind of thing (only if they want!).

Uyghurs and Kazakh minorities even have their own “new year” type holiday, where they are given a day off work to celebrate with their families.
