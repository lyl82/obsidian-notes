War on terror, a retrospective

\- Eight trillion dollars spent

\- Iraq is now trading in yuan

\- Assad won the Syrian civil war

\- Afghanistan controlled by Taliban

\- Saudi and Iran aligned against the US

\- And millions dead and displaced

Conclusion: fight Russia and China next!  
反恐战争，回顾性

\- 花了八万亿美元

\- 伊拉克现在正在元交易

\- 阿萨德赢得了叙利亚内战

\- 由塔利班控制的阿富汗

\- 沙特和伊朗与美国保持一致

\- 数百万死亡和流离失所

结论：接下来与俄罗斯和中国战斗！

> 美国的中东政策和姿势是混乱的。几乎每个方面都几乎全部损失了二十年 - 从伊拉克到利比亚再到叙利亚，介于两者之间。失败目录很长。然而，许多人把我们撞到沟里的PPL仍留在了DC的掌舵人！

This is truly beyond parody 🤦‍♂️

A MEP argues in EU parliament against prolonging the war in Ukraine.

They immediately cut his mic, and lecture him on how there's "no democracy and no freedom of speech" in Russia...
