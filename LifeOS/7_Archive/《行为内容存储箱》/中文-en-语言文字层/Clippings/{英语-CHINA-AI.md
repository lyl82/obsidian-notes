That is so TRUE! DeepSeek is a natural outcome of the US pushing Chinese talent out, with policies like Trump’s 10043.  
真实！ DeepSeek是美国将中国人才推翻的自然结果，其政策像特朗普的10043这样的政策。  
  
I’m actually one of the people directly affected—I got a PhD offer from Stanford a few years ago but was denied a US visa. So instead, I went to another ‘Ford’—Oxford—and honestly, I’m really happy here.  
我实际上是直接受到影响的人之一 - 几年前，我从斯坦福大学获得了博士学位，但被拒绝了美国签证。因此，相反，我去了另一个“福特” - 牛津 - 老实说，我在这里真的很高兴。  
  
It's a clear observation before 2020 Trump introduced anti-Chinese student policies, top students from the best universities, like Tsinghua, were all competing to get into US schools. It was a big deal to flex how many Ivy League offers you got. But after 2020, as these policies took effect, top students gradually lost interest in the US and started choosing to stay for PhDs or go to leading tech/trade companies. Actually the 10043 policy was only aimed at 8 top engineering universities in China. But all students could already sense the hostility and started worrying about their safety and the respect they’d get in the US. Since then, getting a US university offer hasn’t been something to be proud of anymore.  
在2020年特朗普引入反中国学生政策之前，这是一个明显的观察，来自最好的大学（例如Tsinghua）的顶级学生都在竞争进入美国学校。对于您获得了多少常春藤联盟提供的东西，这很重要。但是，在2020年之后，随着这些政策生效，顶级学生逐渐失去了对美国的兴趣，并开始选择留下博士学位或去领先的科技/贸易公司。实际上，10043政策仅针对中国的8所顶级工程大学。但是所有学生都可以感觉到敌对情绪，并开始担心他们在美国会得到的尊重。从那时起，获得美国大学的报价就不再是为之骄傲的。  
  
China has an insanely high talent density—they're smart as hell with a strong work ethic. The US is shutting them out while hyping up clowns like Alexandr Wang. And now, the idea of the US trying to import DeepSeek researchers is pretty naive—why would these top scientists even consider moving when they’re already earning top salaries and doing the most fulfilling work of their careers? The real smart move would’ve been to bring in unproven but high-potential talent early on and let DeepSeek happen inside the US.  
中国的人才密度很高 - 他们以强大的职业道德聪明。美国正在将它们拒之门外，同时大肆宣传亚历山德·王（Alexandr Wang）等小丑。而现在，美国试图进口DeepSeek研究人员的想法非常天真 - 为什么这些顶级科学家甚至在他们已经赚取高薪并从事职业生涯中最充实的工作时会考虑搬家？真正的明智之举是在早期引入未经证实但高电势的才能，并让DeepSeek发生在美国内部。  
  
Running a country might not be that different from running a tech company—stay open, win, and earn respect, or close off and watch the next competitor rise.  
经营一个国家可能与经营一家科技公司没有什么不同，而是开放，获胜，赢得尊重，或关闭并观看下一个竞争对手崛起。
