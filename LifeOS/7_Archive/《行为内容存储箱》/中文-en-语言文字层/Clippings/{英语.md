Absolutely mind-numbing contradictions in this article by Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic (the company behind Claude AI).

He simultaneously argues that Deepseek doesn't matter much, yet begs the U.S. government to ramp up measures to prevent Chinese AI development because it's "existentially important".

And he explains it all as a defense of "democracy vs authoritarianism" yet advocates for the most authoritarian vision of AI you can possibly imagine: using state power to crush open AI development and force global dependence on closed U.S. AI models like his.

Which all goes to show just how threatened U.S. AI companies feel - when you're begging for government intervention to stop others from developing AI, you're effectively admitting defeat since it shows you don't think you can compete on your own merits.  
人类首席执行官达里奥·阿莫迪（Dario Amodei）（克劳德AI背后的公司）的本文中绝对令人麻木的矛盾。

他同时辩称，DeepSeek并不重要，但请美国政府加强措施预防中国人工智能发展，因为这“存在非常重要”。

他将这一切解释为对“民主与威权主义”的辩护，但提倡您可以想象的最专制的人工智能愿景：利用国家权力粉碎开放的AI发展，并迫使全球依赖全球对他的AI模型的依赖。

这一切都表明了我们AI公司的威胁如何 - 当您乞求政府干预以阻止其他人开发AI时，您实际上会承认失败，因为这表明您认为自己不能以自己的优点竞争。
